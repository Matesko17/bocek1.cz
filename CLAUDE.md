# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a WordPress website project for bocek1.cz with several WordPress plugins and a custom theme. The project structure:

- `/bocek/` - Custom WordPress theme (main development area)
- Root directory contains WordPress plugins (ACF, Polylang, etc.)
- `/index.php` - WordPress entry point in root

## Core Theme Architecture

The theme follows a modular structure located in `/bocek/`:

### Key Directories
- `assets/` - Frontend assets (CSS/SCSS, JS, images, fonts)
- `includes/` - PHP functionality organized by purpose:
  - `functions/` - Custom PHP functions
  - `theme_features/` - WordPress theme setup (menus, post types, etc.)
  - `frontend/` - Frontend-related PHP (enqueuing, AJAX, HTML head)
  - `custom_post_types/` - Custom post type definitions
  - `acf/` - Advanced Custom Fields integration
- `parts/blocks/` - Reusable template parts and Gutenberg blocks
- `build/` - Compiled frontend assets (generated by Webpack)

### Asset Pipeline
Uses Webpack for asset compilation with SCSS to CSS conversion, PostCSS autoprefixing, and minification.

## Common Development Commands

Run these commands from the `/bocek/` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
